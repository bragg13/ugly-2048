# Ugly 2048

"Everybody can code 2048 in Javascript!" - so I thought. 
Turns out I can only code an uglier and broken version.
Was fun though!

The whole app is designed in React, the animations use simple css.

## How to run
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
